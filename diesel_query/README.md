# Diesel & Postgres

I want to see what is involved in working with postgres using diesel.

## Goals

- [x] Create a migration.
- [x] Insert data into a simple table.
- [x] Query a simple table.
- [x] Update data in a simple table.
- [x] Join two tables.
- [x] Load data in batches.
- [ ] Load data in batches in a generic way.
- [ ] Use a transaction.
- [ ] Use a postgres extension type (e.g. hstore/postgis).
- [ ] Use a custom filter (e.g. users.filter(adults_only()).

## Notes

A lot I need to learn here to be as productive as I am with Active Record.
