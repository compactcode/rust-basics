# Rust Basics

I've set myself the goal of learning how to build a JSON API server in rust.

This project contains a collection of smaller projects I'm using to break down
the learning process into more managable parts.

- [ ] [PostgreSQL & Diesel](diesel_postgres/)
- [ ] [JSON & Serde](serde_json/)
- [ ] HTTP
- [ ] Docker
- [ ] HTTP & Google Cloud Platform
